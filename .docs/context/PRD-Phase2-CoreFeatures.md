DELETE /api/files/{id} - Delete file
GET /api/files/{id}/download - Download file
```

#### Frontend Components
- FileUploadComponent - File upload interface
- FileListComponent - Display task files
- FilePreviewComponent - File preview modal

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Files can be uploaded to tasks
- [ ] File types are properly validated
- [ ] File size limits are enforced
- [ ] Files can be downloaded
- [ ] Files can be deleted
- [ ] File upload progress is shown

### 5. Advanced Task Features

**Effort**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- Task search functionality
- Task sorting options
- Bulk task operations
- Task templates
- Task recurrence (basic)

#### Features
- Search tasks by title and description

- Basic recurring task functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task search works across all fields
- [ ] Multiple sorting options are available
- [ ] Bulk operations work correctly
- [ ] Task templates can be created and used
- [ ] Basic recurrence is functional

### 6. Comprehensive E2E Testing
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days

#### Requirements
- Complete user journey tests
- Task management workflow tests
- File upload/download tests
- Error scenario testing
- Performance testing

#### Test Scenarios
- User registration and login
- Task creation and management
- Category management
- File upload and download
- Dashboard functionality
- Error handling scenarios

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user journeys are tested
- [ ] Task management workflows are covered
- [ ] File operations are tested
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage is >90%

## Dependencies
