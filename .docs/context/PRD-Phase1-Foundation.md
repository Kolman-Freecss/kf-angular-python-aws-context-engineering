# PRD Phase 1: Foundation Setup

## Overview
Establish the foundational infrastructure for TaskFlow application including Docker setup, basic Angular app, FastAPI backend, and database configuration.

## Objectives
- Set up complete development environment
- Create basic Angular 20 application with routing
- Implement FastAPI backend with health endpoints
- Configure PostgreSQL database with migrations
- Establish basic authentication flow
- Create initial E2E test structure

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Docker Infrastructure
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for Angular frontend
- Multi-stage Dockerfile for FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL container with proper configuration
- LocalStack container for AWS services simulation
- Docker Compose orchestration with proper networking
- Environment variable configuration

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All services start successfully with `docker-compose up`
- [ ] Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Backend API accessible at http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Database accessible and migrations run successfully
- [ ] LocalStack accessible at http://localhost:4566
- [ ] Health check script passes all service checks

### 2. Angular 20 Frontend Foundation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days

#### Requirements
- Angular 20 with standalone components
- Angular Material UI components
- Angular Router with basic routes
- HTTP client with interceptors
- Basic authentication service
- Error handling service
- Loading service

#### Routes Structure
```
/ - Dashboard (protected)
/login - Login page
/register - Registration page
/tasks - Task management (protected)
/profile - User profile (protected)
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Angular 20 application builds successfully
- [ ] All routes are properly configured
- [ ] Authentication guard protects routes
- [ ] HTTP interceptor handles auth tokens
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages
- [ ] Loading states are properly managed

### 3. FastAPI Backend Foundation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3 days

#### Requirements
- FastAPI application with proper structure
- SQLAlchemy with async support
- Alembic for database migrations
- JWT authentication system
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS configuration
- API documentation with Swagger

#### API Endpoints
```
GET / - Root endpoint
GET /health - Health check
POST /api/auth/register - User registration
POST /api/auth/login - User login
GET /api/auth/me - Get current user
POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh token
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI application starts successfully
- [ ] Database migrations run without errors
- [ ] JWT authentication works correctly
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper responses
- [ ] Swagger documentation is accessible
- [ ] CORS is properly configured

### 4. Database Schema
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- User table with authentication fields
- Task table with basic fields
- Category table for task categorization
- Proper relationships and constraints
- Database indexes for performance

#### Schema Design
```sql
Users Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- email (Unique)
- username (Unique)
- hashed_password
- is_active
- created_at
- updated_at

Categories Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- name (Unique)
- color
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- created_at

Tasks Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- title
- description
- status (todo, in_progress, done)
- priority (low, medium, high, urgent)
- due_date
- category_id (Foreign Key)
- user_id (Foreign Key)
- created_at
- updated_at
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Database schema is properly designed
- [ ] All tables are created successfully
- [ ] Foreign key relationships work correctly
- [ ] Database indexes are created
- [ ] Sample data can be inserted

### 5. Basic Authentication Flow
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2 days

#### Requirements
- User registration with validation
- User login with JWT token generation
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password reset functionality
- Protected route handling

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register successfully
- [ ] Users can login and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated
- [ ] Protected routes require authentication
- [ ] Token refresh works correctly
- [ ] Password reset flow is functional

### 6. E2E Testing Foundation
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 1 day

#### Requirements
- Cypress configuration
- Basic test structure
- Authentication flow tests
- API integration tests
- Test data fixtures

#### Test Coverage
- [ ] User registration flow
- [ ] User login flow
- [ ] Protected route access
- [ ] API health check
- [ ] Error handling

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cypress is properly configured
- [ ] Basic test suite runs successfully
- [ ] Authentication tests pass
- [ ] API tests pass
- [ ] Test fixtures are properly set up

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+

## Success Metrics
- All services start successfully
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
- Database operations are functional
- E2E tests pass
- Development environment is stable

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Docker configuration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven Docker patterns and test thoroughly
- **Risk**: Database migration issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement proper rollback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Authentication security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Follow security best practices and use proven libraries

## Deliverables
1. Complete Docker setup with all services
2. Angular 20 application with routing and authentication
3. FastAPI backend with JWT authentication
4. Database schema with migrations
5. Basic E2E test suite
6. Documentation for setup and usage

## Timeline
**Total Duration**: 1 week
- Day 1-2: Docker infrastructure setup
- Day 3-5: Angular and FastAPI development
- Day 6: Database schema and authentication
- Day 7: E2E testing and documentation
